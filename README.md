# req-proxy
Node.js framework agnostic library that enables you to forward an http request to another HTTP server. 
Supported protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2

> This library forked from `fastify-reply-from`: https://github.com/fastify/fastify-reply-from

## Install
```
npm i req-proxy
```

## Usage
The following examples describe how to use `req-proxy` with `restana`:

Gateway:
```js
const { proxy, close } = require('req-proxy')({
  // options
})
const gateway = require('restana')()

gateway.all('/service/*', function (req, res) {
  proxy(req, res, 'http://127.0.0.1:3000' + req.url, {})
})

gateway.start(8080)
```

Remote service:
```js
const service = require('restana')()
service.get('/service/hi', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'))

service.start(3000)
```

## API

### Options
#### `base`
Set the base URL for all the forwarded requests. Will be required if `http2` is set to `true`
Note that _path will be discarded_.

#### http2
Set to `true` if target server is `http2` enabled.

#### cacheURLs
The number of parsed URLs that will be cached. Default: 100.

#### keepAliveMsecs
Defaults to 1 minute, passed down to [`http.Agent`][http-agent] and
[`https.Agent`][https-agent] instances.

#### maxSockets
Defaults to 2048 sockets, passed down to [`http.Agent`][http-agent] and
[`https.Agent`][https-agent] instances.

#### rejectUnauthorized
Defaults to `true`, passed down to [`https.Agent`][https-agent] instances.
This needs to be set to `false`Â to reply from https servers with
self-signed certificates.

### close
Optional _"on `close` resource release"_ strategy. You can link this to your application shutdown hook as an example.

### proxy(originReq, originRes, source, [opts])
Enables you to forward an http request to another HTTP server.
```js
proxy(
  originReq,                          // http.IncomingMessage 
  originRes,                          // http.ServerResponse
  remoteServiceBaseUrl + req.url,     // String
  {}                                  // Options described below
)
```
#### opts
##### onResponse(req, res, buffer)
Called when an http response is received from the source.
The default behavior is `res.end(buffer)`, which will be disabled if the
option is specified.

##### rewriteHeaders(headers)
Called to rewrite the headers of the response, before them being copied
over to the outer response.
It must return the new headers object.

##### queryString
Replaces the original querystring of the request with what is specified.
This will get passed to
[`querystring.stringify`](https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_stringify_obj_sep_eq_options).

Special thanks to `fastify-reply-from` developers for creating a production ready library that we could initially fork.
